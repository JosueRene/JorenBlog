#Django Blog
This is my first craziest Django project and I look forward to level up. Anyways, since it is a django project tagalong with these steps to open it in your browser:
.Open the terminal
.cd jorenblog
.python manage.py runserver
.open the link by ctrl+enter
.in the browser add "/JorenBlog/" to access the first page
